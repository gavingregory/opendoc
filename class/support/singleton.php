/**
 * This trait provides Singleton pattern (only one instance for the concrete class) to the classes that use it.
 * All the entire application can accept its only instance via the public static method getInstance(),
 * provided by the trait.
 * If somebody tries to clone or serialize the object, the trait throws RuntimeException.
 * The static property for the only instance is declared as protected and is instantiated with the 'static' keyword
 * to ensure the posibility of class extending.
